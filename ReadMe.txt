This is a simple program to show how FSK caller id is generated for PSTN phone lines.

As FSK is widely used to transmit data over communication channels, I just write this sample program to find how it works.

Both MDMF and SDMF protocols are implemented. 

This project can be compiled by using visual studio 2013.
